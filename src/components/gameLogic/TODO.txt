ITEM SHOP
=============================

TODO: when changing the army, close the item shop

 TODO: Items fuck up your commander/unit cards!
    - adding the items destroys the layout 
    - first idea: isntead of adding it to the end of the backside, add a third card with the equipment


-------------CURRENTLY WORKING ON-----------------
TODO: you can only choose one poison!

- well it's not working. It should. seems like a state problem (surprise :D). The button that opens the shop sets 
  two state variables, that's a fucking issue. You need to make it one! 


 
 TODO: when selecting an item add the following to the unit card 
        - the special rules [DONE] 
        - change the stats
